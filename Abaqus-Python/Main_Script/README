The Abaqus-Python program includes an operation file (Abaqus_Python_Auto_v2.py) and a function file (Abaqus_Python_Functions) that contains all necessary functions. 

It is important to note that this program is only compatible with Abaqus versions higher than 2021 as it utilizes the matplotlib toolkit, 
which is only supported in Abaqus from 2021 onwards. 
If run in an earlier version of Abaqus, the Abaqus CAE program may crash or stop functioning.

Before running the operation script, the function file must be placed in the Abaqus lib directory. 
For example, in the author's case, the lib directory is located at D:\SIMULIA\EstProducts\2021\win_b64\tools\SMApy\python2.7\lib.

To ensure that the matplotlib toolkit is working properly, a pre-run code should be tested in the Abaqus terminal. 
If the code in Pre_run.py runs successfully in the Abaqus terminal, it indicates that the matplotlib toolkit is functioning well
and the operation script can be executed.
